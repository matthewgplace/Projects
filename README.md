# Projects

Project 4 is the Astronomical Spectrograph application that I developed with C++ using Windows Forms in Visual Studio.

main.c is my source code for my CCD Sensor Imaging Circuit PsOC Creator project. The entire project contained too many files to upload, so to make it simpler, I only uploaded the code file here. This code is in C and allows the circuit to control the CCD sensor, as well as allows the circuit to interface to a computer via USB.
